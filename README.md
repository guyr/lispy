A lispy python dialect implemented in pure python

goals:
* lisp-like data-structure representation of python code
* lisp-like macros

design points:
* share python's data model, functionalize control structures
* lisp-like syntax
* be as easy as possible to understand for python programmers
* python orthogonality (reflect underlying python behavior, capabilities and performance)
* minimal python "microcode"
